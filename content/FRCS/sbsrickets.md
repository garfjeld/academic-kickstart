Define: Rickets is a defect in mineralisation of the osteoid matrix that occurs before physical closure.

Features: clinically it is associated with
* Long bones
    * Physical cupping
    * Bowing
* Spine
    * Codfish vertebrae
    * Kyphosis
* Thorax
    * Rachitic rosary

Pathology: Disruption of the normal Ca/Phos metabolism causes poor calcification in the Zone of Provisional Calcification can occur through a number of different mechanisms
* Nutritional deficiencies (Vitamin D common; Calcium and Phosphate rarer)
* Renal tubular defects and osteodystrophy
* GI absorption disorders

## Vitamin D deficiency
Rarer now that Vitamin D is added to milk. Risk factors include prematurity, asian immigrants, and malabsorption.

### Say
1. Low Ca is sensed by chief cells which release PTH
2. PTH acts to upregulate osteoclasts via OB differentiation, inhibiting OPG and increasing RANKL, butâ€¦
3. Deficiency means feedback cannot act to increase 1,25 Vitamin D so strong signal for GI absorption is absent
4. Net effect is that balance between PTH and Vitamin D is lost so that Ca is maintained by PTH (**secondary hyperparathyroidism**) action on the bone, presenting as rickets

Usually managed with dietary replacement of Vitamin D.

### Draw
Low Vitamin D uncouples its effect from PTH which supports Ca at the expense of Phos

### Calcium and phosphate deficiencies

Follow a similar pattern but are rarer.

In Ca deficiency, low Ca drives PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism) and conversion of 25 Vit D to 1,25 Vit D. The biochemical findings are similar, with PTH driving raised Alk Phos, low serum Phos, low urinary Ca, but also depleting 25 Vit D stores.

In Phos deficiency, proximal tubule is stimulated to convert 25 Vit D to 1,25 Vit D and depleting its stores, but there is no PTH stimulus so no secondary hyperparathyroidism.

## Hereditary Vitamin D dependent rickets
Similar feaures to Vitamin D deficient rickets, but tends to be more severe and associated with total baldness. There are two types with an analgous aetiology to diabetes type 1 & 2:
1. Type 1 is caused by *reduced production of 1,25 Vitamin D* due to a defect in 1-alpha hydroxylase.
2. Type 2 is caused by *insensitivity to 1,25 Vitamin D* due to a receptor mutation.

### Say - Type 1

1. Type 1 is an autosomal recessive mutation in the 1 alpha hydroxylase gene
2. 1,25 Vitamin D dependent Ca homeostasis cannot occur
3. This drives a secondary hyperparathyroidism
4. Consequent imbalance in net effects of PTH and Vitamin D, which tends to present more severely than pure dietary Vitamin D deficiency.

Treatment is by oral supplementation of *activated* 1,25 Vitamin D at physiological doses (1-2 microgram per day)

### Draw - Type 1

### Say - Type 2
1. Type 2 is also autosomal recessive, but affects the 1,25 Vitamin D *receptor*, blocking its end organ effects
2. Loss of negative feedback drives *significantly raised 1,25 Vit D levels* and a fall in precursors
3. These are ineffective at maintaining serum Ca and Phos which stimulates PTH
4. The net effect is very high levels of activated Vitamin D with low serum and urinary Ca

Treatment is high dose Vitamin D with elementary calcium.

### Draw - Type 2
