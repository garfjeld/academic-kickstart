Define: Rickets is a defect in mineralisation of the osteoid matrix that occurs before physical closure.

Features: clinically it is associated with
* Long bones
    * Physical cupping
    * Bowing
* Spine
    * Codfish vertebrae
    * Kyphosis
* Thorax
    * Rachitic rosary

Pathology: Disruption of the normal Ca/Phos metabolism causes poor calcification in the Zone of Provisional Calcification can occur through a number of different mechanisms
* Nutritional deficiencies (Vitamin D common; Calcium and Phosphate rarer)
* Renal tubular defects and osteodystrophy
* GI absorption disorders

## Vitamin D deficient
Rarer now that Vitamin D is added to milk. Risk factors include prematurity, asian immigrants, and malabsorption.

### Say
1. Low Ca is sensed by chief cells which release PTH
2. PTH acts to upregulate osteoclasts via OB differentiation, inhibiting OPG and increasing RANKL, butâ€¦
3. Deficiency means feedback cannot act to increase 1,25 Vitamin D so strong signal for GI absorption is absent
4. Net effect is that balance between PTH and Vitamin D is lost so that Ca is maintained by PTH action on the bone, presenting as rickets
Usually managed with dietary replacement of Vitamin D.

### Draw
Low Vitamin D uncouples its effect from PTH which supports Ca at the expense of Phos
